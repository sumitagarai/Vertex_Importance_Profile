## Repository structure

All the experiments are issued in the form of pretty self-explanatory jupyter notebooks (`notebooks/`). For preserving patient privacy in healthcare data, the majority of the evaluation output is hidden.

- ```VIP_ADNI.ipynb``` - For computing vertex importance profiles for ADNI subjects 
- ```VIP_HCP.ipynb``` -  For computing vertex importance profiles for HCP subjects 


## Datasets
- Human Connectome Project- Young Adults (HCP-YA)
- Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-3)
